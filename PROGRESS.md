# Progress

## Phase 0 — Scaffolding & tooling

**Built:**
- Repo layout: `backend/` (FastAPI) and `app/` (Expo/TypeScript) at repo root.
- `docker-compose.yml` with a single `postgres:16` service (user/pass/db: `user`/`pass`/`expenses`,
  matching `backend/.env.example`).
- `backend/`: `pyproject.toml` (hatchling backend, no poetry/uv on this machine), `.venv`,
  minimal `app/main.py` (FastAPI instance, no routes yet — `/health` is Phase 1), pytest
  configured, `tests/test_smoke.py`.
- `app/`: Expo TypeScript app via `create-expo-app`, Jest configured with `jest-expo` +
  `@testing-library/react-native`, smoke test in `__tests__/App.test.tsx`.
- `.gitignore` covering both stacks.
- `CLAUDE.md` rewritten to reflect this project's working agreement (was previously unrelated
  content from another project).

**Tested:**
- `backend`: `pytest` → 1 passed. `uvicorn app.main:app` booted and served `/docs` with 200.
- `app`: `npx jest` → 1 passed. `npx expo start` brought up the Metro bundler on
  `localhost:8081` without error.

**Manual steps for the human:**
- ~~Docker Desktop install~~ — done. `brew install --cask docker` failed (needs an interactive
  `sudo` password this session can't supply), so the human installed Docker Desktop directly
  instead. Verified working: `docker compose up -d` pulls `postgres:16` and starts it on
  `localhost:5432`, `pg_isready` confirms it accepts connections.
- No Xcode / iOS Simulator on this machine — preview the app via **Expo Go** on a physical device
  by running `npx expo start` inside `app/` and scanning the QR code, rather than `npm run ios`.
- Node is v22.9.0; several Expo SDK 57 / React Native 0.86 packages request `^22.13.0+`
  (`EBADENGINE` warnings during `npm install`, non-fatal so far). Consider upgrading Node if
  real issues show up later.
